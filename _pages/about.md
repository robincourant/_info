I am a PhD student in Computer Vision, affiliated with the [VISTA](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/) team (previously [GeoViC](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/geovic/)) at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/), [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), under the supervision of [Vicky Kalogeiton](https://vicky.kalogeiton.info/) and [Marc Christie](http://people.irisa.fr/Marc.Christie/). Previously, I was a research engineer in the [VirtUs](https://team.inria.fr/virtus/) team at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) mentored by [Marc Christie](http://people.irisa.fr/Marc.Christie/). I also completed an end-of-study internship in the [VISTA](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/) team at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/), supervised by [Vicky Kalogeiton](https://vicky.kalogeiton.info/), [Marc Christie](http://people.irisa.fr/Marc.Christie/), and [Christophe Lino](https://sites.google.com/site/christophelino/). I hold a Master's in Mathematical and Computational Engineering from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr).

My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and cinematography in two axes: extracting cinematic features and generating cinematic content.
